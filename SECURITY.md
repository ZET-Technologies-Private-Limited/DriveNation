# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are currently provided for the latest `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly:

1. Do not create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability.
2. Contact the maintainers privately with:
   - a clear description of the issue
   - reproduction steps
   - impact assessment
   - suggested remediation (if available)

If private security contact details are not configured yet, open a minimal issue asking maintainers to provide a secure reporting channel.

## Response Process

Once reported, maintainers aim to:

- acknowledge receipt promptly
- validate and triage severity
- prepare and release a fix
- publish guidance when appropriate

Please allow reasonable time for investigation and coordinated disclosure.
